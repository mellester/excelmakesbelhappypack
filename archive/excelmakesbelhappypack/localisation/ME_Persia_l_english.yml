 persia_the_shahs_capital_desc: "We have truly been blessed! None other has managed to unite successfully this turbulent region. This is surely a sign of Allah, rewarding us for our steadfast faith upon Him. However, no Empire is complete without its own beautiful capital heart, adorned with gold and silver, truly matches the grandeur of our dynasty!"
 persia_clergy_governors_title: "Clergy Governors"
 persia_clergy_governors_desc: "Bureaucracy has always been a troublesome aspect of running Empires of our size.

 persia_academy_of_baghdad_title: "Academy of [410.GetName]"

 persia_turkmen_of_the_west_desc: "It has been noted that we share a common root with the beasts residing our western border, the fearsome clans of the White and Black Sheep.

These uncivilized horsemasters are nothing but bugs biting on our heels, we will do good to have them perish or join our ranks."
 persia_an_eternal_rivalry_title: "An Eternal Rivalry"
 persia_an_eternal_rivalry_desc: "Border expansion usually entails the acquisition of more goods to sell, more land to cultivate.

 persia_golden_era_title: "[Root.GetAdjective] Golden Era"
 persia_golden_era_desc: "Having embraced a nation-wide institution of universities while promoting academic studies for most commoners, we have achieved a level of education and critical thinking never before seen.

 persia_modernize_the_qizilbash_title: "Modernize the Qizilbash"
 persia_modernize_the_qizilbash_desc: "Truthfully a dominant factor of our ever-growing power is none other than our Redhead warriors, commonly known as The Qizilbash. While purchasing Janissaries has proven a good deal for us, given the fact that they are formidable warriors, we should not rest our defense on these foreigners and instead work on improving our own Infantry Units."
 persia_masters_of_the_horse_title: "Masters of the Horse"
 persia_masters_of_the_horse_desc: "Turkoman horses used to be the travel and battle companions of our ancestors. Sturdy and strong horses with unyielding resolve, they managed to win many crucial battles and secure our existence. However, if we are to continue using them in the age of gunpowder, we should selectively breed only the best horses and train our cavalry armies to withstand the shock and awe of the gunpowder fire."
 persia_dar_al_islam_title: "Dar-al Islam"
 persia_dar_al_islam_desc: "Victory after victory, we have crushed our enemies as they are driven before us. Carrying the banner of Islam, our territory now reaches further than any other Persian king while we set our sights to fulfill the will of Allah and unify the world of Islam."

 persia_merchants_of_persia_title: "Merchants of Persia"
 persia_merchants_of_persia_desc: "Trade has always been a lucrative business in Persia. Partly due to the region's position between the riches of India, Asia and Europe.

 persia_kingdom_of_hormuz_title: "Kingdom of Hormuz"
 persia_kingdom_of_hormuz_desc: "Long ago existed a prestigious kingdom between Arabia and Persia. By controlling the strait that separates the two regions, they managed to build a formidable mercantile and naval presence in the area. A revival of such magnitude would surely provide us with a docile subject and ample amounts of profit."
 persia_into_gujarat_title: "Into Gujarat"
 persia_into_gujarat_desc: "While we control a significant monopoly in areas like Lahore and Hormuz, we have yet to reach further across the western coast of India. Valuable ports of trade across the Gujarat coast shall serve to ferry our products into our markets, enriching our merchants."

 persia_gateway_to_india_desc: "To our East lies the lucrative province of Kabul. A gem lodged between the mountains, Kabul has long been the link between Indian and Persian Merchants.

 persia_riches_of_india_title: "Riches of India"
 persia_riches_of_india_desc: "Beyond the mountainous tips of Kabul and Roh, lies the lush fertile land of India, Lahore. A region rich in many valuable goods such as Cloth and Silk, its wealth would make a fine addition to our state budget."

 # Events:
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTNAME1: "Heart of the Empire"
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTDESC1: "An Empire is only as lavish and prospering as its capital. Every acclaimed Emperor before us made sure his city was the most beautiful in all of the land. Thus we have to choose a province to represent our beliefs, grandeur and wealth. A crown jewel to look upon, a city to serve as the emblem of our prestigious Empire across the ages. As our advisors argue over the best option, a loud voice is heard from the throne room: 'Our new metropolis shall be...'."
 ME_Persia_Events1.EVTOPT1: "... §Y[416.GetName]§! for its defensible fortifications."
 ME_Persia_Events1.EVTOPT2: "... §Y[410.GetName]§!, the city of peace."
 ME_Persia_Events1.EVTOPT3: "... §Y[428.GetName]§!, the city of silk."
 
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTNAME4: "Georgian Representation"
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTDESC4: "Prolonged conflict on our southern border has ceased for the first time in centuries. As we attempt to reign the Georgians in, we should not make the same mistakes previous liberators did. Dominating them will turn into a delicate procedure of checks and balances around their freedoms and their rights, or so our advisors say. while a delegate of the Georgian court awaits our answer."
 ME_Persia_Events4.EVTOPT1: "A fine addition to my collection."
 ME_Persia_Events4.EVTOPT2: "You're a disease and I am the cure."
 
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTNAME5: "Fate of the Two Sheep"
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTDESC5: "When our ancestors, offspring of the Great Khan who first razed and repopulated these lands, settled, they saw fit to withdraw from the brotherhood of the clans, bring down the authority of their leaders and raise their own banners. However, much to their dismay, it takes more than a fresh banner and a change in name in order to not be a sheep. Having destroyed these renegade tribes, we must now decide what to do with them as they beg and plead to be spared."
 ME_Persia_Events5.EVTOPT1: "Talk to the hand."
 ME_Persia_Events5.EVTOPT2: "Allah forgives and so do we."
 
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTNAME6: "End of Osman"
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTDESC6: "All you had to do, was keep the caliphate alive, fool!"
 ME_Persia_Events6.EVTOPT1: "Forgive and forget."
 ME_Persia_Events6.EVTOPT2: "They burn."
 
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTNAME7: "[Root.GetAdjective] Military Reforms"
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTDESC7: "Moving into the new century, warfare as we know it will undergo drastic changes as the nations of the West will slowly yet steadily abandon the horse and fully adopt gunpowder. As we pride ourselves to be on the forefront of military technology, we need to decide the direction to which we should steer our mighty military, a decision that will shape the future of our great Empire."
 ME_Persia_Events7.EVTOPT1: "Our ancestors favored the horse, and so shall we."
 ME_Persia_Events7.EVTOPT2: "Let us strive to build a standing army."
 
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTNAME8: "A Modern Horse"
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTDESC8: "Life always finds a way. That much is true regarding warhorses used by our ancestors. Bred to charge into enemy infantry with devastating force, the Turkoman horse used to be a formidable opponent in battle. However, times are changing and maybe so should we. The matter of debate between our advisors is not exactly whether or not we should change but rather, how much we should change."
 ME_Persia_Events8.EVTOPT1: "We should embrace our traditions completely."
 ME_Persia_Events8.EVTOPT2: "Let us raise our own breed of horse."
 
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTNAME10: "Guardians of the Strait"
 ME_Persia_Events.EVTDESC10: "Lucrative trade, exotic goods and spices have been flowing through the straits of Persia for centuries. Oftentimes, these merchant travels would be raided by slaver captains, sea dogs out to rob the common folk of their goods. In order to crack down on these outlaws, we should decide on how to approach the situation, given the delicate situation the straits are in right now."
 ME_Persia_Events10.EVTOPT1: "No pirates in my Carr- err, Strait!"
 ME_Persia_Events10.EVTOPT2: "We shall deal with them ourselves."
