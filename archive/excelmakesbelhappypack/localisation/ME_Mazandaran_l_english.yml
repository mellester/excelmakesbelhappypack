 #Form Mazandaran
 form_mazandaran_nation_title: "Unite the Caspian Kingdoms"
 form_mazandaran_nation_desc: "The Caspian coast is dotted with tiny, irrelevant kingdoms, on the verge of succumbing to an invasion at any time by a motivated power. All of because of petty dynastic quarrels. The feuding must end if we are to remain independent, and Mazandaran must be reunited."
 
 #Generic Caspian Minor Missions
 cpm_ally_ardabil_title: "Relations with the Safavids"
 cpm_ally_ardabil_desc: "Our long term ally has always been the Safaviyya Order of Ardabil. We must nurture this relationship, so that we may reap the benefits when we have sufficiently expanded!"
 cpm_mountain_training_title: "Mountain Training"
 cpm_mountain_training_desc: "The rugged landscape of Iran spells nothing but trouble for those choosing to send their troops into our lands. We must take advantage of this as much as possible, specializing our troops to fight in the most extreme climates."
 cpm_allies_title: "Secure Our Position"
 cpm_allies_desc: "The nations of the Caspian Sea are surrounded by invaders on every side, envious of our rich trading cities. Unless we form a network of alliances, we will be a footnote in history, integrated into some less worthy power!"
 cpm_conquer_mazandaran_title: "Conquest of Mazandaran"
 cpm_conquer_mazandaran_desc: "The final pretender to the Sultanate of Mazandaran, the Afrasiyabs of Amol, are all that lie in the way of dominating the Caspian coast. Their conquest would mark the first time in centuries the Caspian Sea be unified by a local power."
 cpm_conquer_rival_title: "Crush the Pretenders"
 cpm_conquer_rival_desc: "Our rivals have claimed the area of greater Gilan for themselves, refusing to acknowledge us as the rightful ruler. Such insolence must not go unpunished!"
 cpm_caspian_bastion_title: "A Caspian Bastion"
 cpm_caspian_bastion_desc: "Our nation is small, surrounded by neighbors into which expansion would be difficult. Therefore, urbanization of the cities is key to maintaining sovereignty. No longer should the coast of the Caspian be dotted with small villages."
 cpm_army_title: "Increase the Garrisons"
 cpm_army_desc: "Being so isolated from the rest of Persia is damning of the other sultans' opinions of us. They look upon us with greed in their us, seeing us as just another province to conquer. We must remain vigilant, ready for an invasion at all times."
 cpm_silk_trade_title: "Caspian Silk Trade"
 cpm_silk_trade_desc: "The heart of our economy is of course silk. The Caspian coast is a natural gateway from Europe to Asia, so it is imperative that the silk trade in our lands be expanded."
 cpm_silk_dominance_title: "Niche in the Silk Road"
 cpm_silk_dominance_desc: "We have reaped the benefits of the Silk Road for certain, but there is always more to be gained. While merchants flock to our markets looking for a good deal on silk, our actual production of the material is low compared to other players in the industry. Workshops are a must if we're to keep up."
 cpm_develop_rasht_title: "The Gate of Europe"
 cpm_develop_rasht_desc: "The city of Rasht has been described by Frank and Turk alike to be the "Gate of Europe". A commerical hotspot in the silk road, it must be expanded enough for us to project our trade power."
 cpm_mosques_title: "Devotion to God"
 cpm_mosques_desc: "Although primarily focused on military and economic growth, our nation must not forget the core principles that tie Persia together. Namely, the Shiite sect of Islam. Neglecting the citizens' spiritual needs is as heinous as denying them bread or water. Mosques are a necessity for the nation to thrive."

 #Gilan/Ardabil Events
 ME_TAB.1.t: "A Request From Gilan"
 ME_TAB.1.d: "The Sultan of Gilan has sent an envoy to our court requesting our allegiance when he has conquered all of the Caspian coast. While we deem this highly unlikely, the Safavid order does have strong ties with the court of Gilan, and should they become strong it wouldn't be the worst fate to fight alongside them."
 ME_TAB.1.a: "We will support the Sultan of Gilan however necessary."
 ME_TAB.1.b: "And risk our independence? As if!"
 ME_TAB.2.t: "Ardabil Aligns With Us"
 ME_TAB.2.d: "Our envoy has returned, bearing great news! The Sultan of Ardabil has declared his support for us, and is willing to serve in our court if we manage to conquer the surrounding pretenders."
 ME_TAB.2.a: "Great!"
 ME_TAB.3.t: "Ardabil Refuses to Support Us"
 ME_TAB.3.d: "Our envoy has returned, bearing unfortunate news. The Sultan of Ardabil claims his ambitions outweigh our own, and that he refuses to serve in any court except his own."
 ME_TAB.3.a: "So much for friendship."
 ME_TAB.4.t: "The Promise to Gilan"
 ME_TAB.4.d: "Despite what the advisors have suggested, the Sultan of Gilan has actually managed to consolidate Tabarestan for himself. This presents us with a predicament: fulfill our promise to the Sultan and give up our independence, or become the most dishonorable Sultan in Persia. Either way, we should have intervened a long time ago."
 ME_TAB.4.a: "We have no choice but to keep our word."
 ME_TAB.4.b: "A bad reputation today secures an independent Ardabil tomorrow."
 ME_TAB.5.t: "A Broken Oath"
 ME_TAB.5.d: "The Safavids have blatantly disregarded the oath they gave us those many years ago, that they would join us once we united Mazandaran. This is an act of treachery, and must be acted upon as such."
 ME_TAB.5.a: "If the Sultan will not be our knight, he will be our pawn."
 ME_TAB.6.t: "A Promise Fulfilled"
 ME_TAB.6.d: "The Sultan of Ardabil has remembered his promise to us and has sworn his allegiance. With all the pieces falling in place, our proper title as Shah is only years away from returning to us."
 ME_TAB.6.a: "Great news!"
 me_tab_promise_to_gilan_tt: "By choosing this option we are making a promise to become a vassal of Gilan once they form Mazandaran. If we break this promise, the Sultan will retaliate!"
