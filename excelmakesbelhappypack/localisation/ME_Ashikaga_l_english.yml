 # Events:
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.1.t: "Daimyo Contribution"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.1.d: "Being a Daimyo is a mutual obligation to a lord or monarch, in the context of the Japanese feudal system in medieval Nippon. The obligations often included military support by samurai warriors in exchange for certain privileges, usually including land held as a tenant or fief. We are now able to expand their obligations in a multitude of ways, including but not limited to coin or working hands for the upgrade and expansion of our beautiful capital."
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.1.a: "We will require contribution in coin"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.1.b: "Let us demand people for our capital"
 
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.2.t: "Daijo Tenno"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.2.d: "A ceremonial abdication, or Daijo Tenno, is the process through which an heirless Shogun of advanced age retires peacefully from the throne in favor of the brightest young mind of the court. Originally compiled at the direction of Prince Osakabe, Fujiwara no Fuhito and Awata no Mahito, the work began at the request of Emperor Monmu and, like many other developments in the country at the time, it was largely an adaptation of the governmental system of China's Tang dynasty."
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.2.a: "The throne is his."
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.2.b: "The throne is mine!"
 
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.3.t: "The Offer for Okinawa"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.3.d: "To the south of our great island lies the mysterious community of Ryuku. Despite sharing the region, we have little contact with them. Perhaps we could send them a friendly delegation with gifts from our Shogun and offer them a hand of friendship in the hopes of them one day joining us as our subject. A costly endeavor, surely, but one that might be worth it after all!"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.3.a: "Make them a grand offer!"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.3.b: "This money is best spent elsewhere"
 
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.4.t: "An Offer of Vassalage"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.4.d: "Emissaries from the so-called Emperor of Japan have appeared on our small community. They speak of a powerful decentralized network of lords wrestling to control the entire island. Frankly this sounds too rowdy for our tastes but perhaps we could benefit from joining them?"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.4.a: "We gladly accept!"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.4.b: "We will maintain sovereignty."
 
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.5.t: "Tosenbugyo"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.5.d: "Loosely translated 'commissioner' or 'magistrate', the title of Tosenbugyo is one of immense power, benefits and prestige. For this purpose we should entrust only our strongest and most loyal subject for this task. Historically, the Tosenbugyo was responsible with keeping up the quotas for goods production in their lands as it was meant to be traded in lucrative prices with the Chinese. Moreover part of the magistrate's duties is to ensure the safety of the maritime and merchant routes against the formidable Wokou pirates. What's more, the commissioner will be in charge of the Shogun's bureaucracy and advisor board as [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s right hand.  "
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.5.a: "The [ashikaga_target_1.GetName] will make fine bureaucrats."
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.5.b: "Let's turn to the [ashikaga_target_2.GetName]."
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.5.c: "We will trust the [ashikaga_target_3.GetName]."
 
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.6.t: "Shogun Enforced Peace"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.6.d: "Our serfs are tired of our unending wars. They've come to our court under the seal of the Shogun and his impervious authority, to enforce peace in his name. We could indeed sign the agreement and deescalate the warring situation in the island. However, some of our battle-hardy generals voice a different opinion: to defy the Shogun and decline the disarmament of our glorious army! "
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.6.a: "We shall sign the agreement"
 ME_Ashikaga_Events.6.b: "Never!"
 
 ASK_DAIMYOS_PAY_5_DUCATS: "Every §YDaimyo§! will be forced to give a tribute of §G5§! Ducats."
 ASK_DAIMYOS_LOSE_RANDOM_CAPITAL_DEV: "Every §YDaimyo§! loses §Y1§! random development in their capital."
